# DATA_ETL_Project
Building an Application Using Python and ETL Pipeline for Data Retrieval and Processing from Multiple Servers

In this project, we will create a comprehensive application using Python and ETL pipeline that automates the process of accessing and retrieving data from various servers like SVN, GIT, Jira, Bugzilla, Clearcase, Jenkins or migrating from MySQL database. We will use necessary libraries like pandas, numpy, pyodbc, sqlalchemy, paramiko and more to make this process possible.

Problem Statement

Businesses around the world are generating enormous amounts of data every day. However, handling and processing this data can be a cumbersome task. 
This project aims to provide a solution that automates the process of accessing and retrieving data from various sources, and process that raw data into final digital 
form using ETL pipeline.

Solution

 Is an application that can connect to various servers and databases like SVN, GIT, Jira, and SQL using Python scripts that use etl pipeline. 
 The data collected from these servers and databases is then processed using pandas and numpy to obtain a final digital form. 
 The application should be portable, which means that it can be easily installed on any system without the need for any additional libraries or dependencies.

Steps Involved

Connect to SVN, GIT, Jira, SQL server/database using Python scripts. (paramiko/pyodbc)
Collect desired data by creating MySQL queries from the servers/db and export locally using Python scripts.
Create scripts to process raw data into final digital form using Pandas/NumPy.
Creating a portable (.exe) application that allows the user to receive the desired processed data.
Libraries Used
Pandas - for processing and manipulating data.
NumPy - for numerical computing and data analysis.
PyODBC - for connecting to SQL Server.
SQLAlchemy - for connecting to various databases.
Paramiko - for connecting to servers (SSH).
Advantages of our application
Easy to use and user-friendly interface.
Automation of a cumbersome process, which saves time and money.
The ability to connect to various servers and databases with ease.
The application is portable and can be installed on any system without additional dependencies.

In conclusion, this project aims to make data retrieval and processing an easy and seamless process by creating an application that automates the process of accessing and retrieving data from various sources using Python and ETL pipeline. The application is user-friendly, portable, and easy to use, making it an ideal solution for businesses that want to handle and process large amounts of data with ease.
